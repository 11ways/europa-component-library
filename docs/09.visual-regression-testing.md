## Visual regression testing

Visual regression tests for Storybook's stories are ran in [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com) in order to have consistent display throughout.

### Requirements

In order to run tests locally, you will need:

- [Sauce Labs account](https://app.saucelabs.com/signup)
- [Sauce Connect](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Sauce+Connect+Proxy)

### Environment variables

Please set the following:

```sh
export SAUCE_USERNAME=
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=
export TEST_BROWSER=
export ECL_SYSTEM=
```

### Build storybooks

```sh
$ yarn dist:storybook
```

This will build all systems' storybooks and store them in a `dist` folder.

When running tests locally, this `dist` folder will need to be served and exposed to Sauce Labs's cloud in order for its driver to be able to see components.

### Running tests

Use [Sauce Connect runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sauceconnect-runner) (or Sauce Connect directly) to open a tunnel from your local environment to Sauce Lab's virtualized browsers in the cloud:

```sh
$ sc-run yarn test:visual
```

If you run the test suite several times in a raw and you start getting hard-to-debug differences in snapshots/screenshots, ensure to clear `jest`'s cache:

```sh
$ jest --clearCache
```

### Updating references

```sh
$ yarn test:visual-update
```

### Target browsers

The following browsers are supported in `TEST_BROWSER` variable:

- `chrome`
- `ie`
- `safari`
- `firefox`

### ECL Systems

Possible values for `ECL_SYSTEM`:

- `ec`
- `eu`
