## Do's

- allow users to upload a file in the commonly accepted formats, don't ask them to convert files to a specific format
- specify accepted formats in advance, through the use of the file extension (.png, .jpeg, .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, etc)
- specify maximum file size in advance, if there is one

## Don'ts

- don't limit the file upload size or type, unless specifically mentioned in the file requirements

## When to use

- use when users are asked to upload files, necessary to completing their task
- use when one or multiple files must be uploaded as part of an application (e.g. Grants & funding applications)

## When not to use

- when there is no need to upload documents
- when certain information is better processed (and organised) by other input fields

## Notes

### Content

Write clear messages to inform or warn users about the upload task:

- if the file upload wasn't completed
- if the file type can't be uploaded
- if the file is too big
- if the file is empty
- if the file contains a virus
- if the file is password protected
